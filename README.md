# VGDDC-discordbot
discord bot to manage VGDDC server

this is mostly me trying to figure out how to do what i want to do

## current implemented commands:
with '!' prefix


|command            |discription|
|-------------------|-----------|
|sacrifice @\<user\>|send the user to the underworld, and they will be scorned each time they speak|
|resurrect @\<user\>|return user to the living using dark magics|
|avatar             |posts the image link to your avatar|
|help               |dislay help text|

# Goals
* store club members skill description
* obtain member's skill description upon command
* manage roles based on skill tier and skills obtained

 (list will grow as features are thought up)
